#Subtitution Cipher 

 	This is the implementation of the famous , very old subtituion cipher using java .

1. Download the .zip file from the git hub and extract all the files into a Directory .

2. Make sure you have JDK ( Java Development Kit ) installled and configured right in your computer

3. Now create a file , "input.text" and write the content you want to encrypt inside that . Please use ony lower cases , spaces and period(.) symbol . This feature is yet to be optimised .

4. You will be provided with a subtition key in "key.text" .You can use this by default . If you want to change the key incase the key was stolen , change the key as per the following ,

	- Take a paper and write from a - z vertically 
	- Now to the right of each alphabet write diffferent alphabets in a random order and make sure letters doesn't 	  repeat  
	- open key.text , you will find something like this 
	 		"jnfmgehyzxbuaopiqwcdvkrs.t l"
	- Type the new sequence of yours .
	- Make sure you place "."(dot) and " " (space) in exactly same places .
	- Save the file under same name "keys.text"
 	
5. Now compile the SubstitutionCipher.java using 

	```javac SubstitutionCipher.java ```
 	
6. Execute the class file created by 

 	```java SubstitutionCipher```
7. Choose 1 do encrypt the content entered in input.text .

8. You can find a file encrypted.text created 

9. Send the encrypted.text to a friend and share the key physically before hand .

10. You can decrypt the file using 2 option if you execute the program again . (Make sure key is present in the same directory )

11. Thanks 

Ping me if you have suggestions where I could improve the code.
